# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Prerequisites**

- **Node.js and npm:** Ensure you have Node.js (version 14.18.0 or later) and npm (bundled with Node.js) installed on your system. You can verify their versions by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If not installed, download them from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/en.
